## Google Hangouts Grid View

This is super rough right now, but it works.

Click the extension icon to toggle it off and on. (It defaults to on)

Huge thanks to [Fugiman's userscript](https://github.com/Fugiman/google-meet-grid-view) which the [meet extension](https://github.com/stgeorgesepiscopal/google-meet-grid-view-extension) uses.

To install, load as an unpacked extension.  I'll get around to putting it on CWS.

PRs very welcome!

* This could probably use UI
* I have no idea what happens with a presentation
* Should users be able to focus (`pinnedIndex`) one of the views?
